HydroTracker is a smart coaster system designed to monitor the fill level of glasses in real time and notify staff when service is needed. By combining load cell sensors, Arduino-based wireless nodes, and a graphical user interface, the system offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for service environments.The system performs reliably, offering accurate state detection and real-time visual feedback. 

Ideally, HydroTracker would be implemented as a fully integrated, wireless, and portable smart device. Instead of relying on a separate Arduino board and wired modules, each coaster node would embed a compact microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) directly into its body, along with a thin rechargeable battery and low-power management for long-term operation. This integration would eliminate external components and wiring, resulting in a cleaner, more robust design. Additionally, wireless connectivity such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) could support seamless data transmission and real-time monitoring across larger spaces or cloud services. Lastly, the ideal sensor for this setup would be a thinner load cell, helping reduce the overall size and visual presence of the coaster, making it more discreet, user-friendly, and visually appealing.
