HydroTracker is a smart coaster system designed to monitor the fill level of glasses in real time and notify staff when service is needed. By combining load cell sensors, Arduino-based wireless nodes, and a graphical user interface, the system offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for service environments.
The system performs reliably, offering accurate state detection (EMPTY, NOTEMPTY, NOTEXIST) and real-time visual feedback. Future improvements may include better power management and integration with cloud platforms for analytics.
